Boxologic
=========

A set of C programs that calculate the best fit for boxes on a pallet, and visualize the result.

Future Plans
------------
This project uses a fairly old codebase as a launching-off point.  The plan is to modernize it a bit, and then add functionality by allowing the user to specify more than one container to be packed, as well as perhaps library-ifying the main code so that you can wrap your own code around it more easily.  Keep watching this space for details as they emerge.

Caveat Emptor
-------------
This codebase is currently undergoing fairly sweeping changes. While we'll try our very best to always have compile-ready, working code here, no guarantees of any sort are made. Currently the visualizer only runs using the windows-only code & binary supplied by the [project this one was forked from](https://github.com/wknechtel/3d-bin-pack). The visualizer in this fork is slated to be rewritten using OpenGL, and will be cross-platform.

Usage
-----
    USAGE:
      boxologic <option>

    OPTIONS:
      [ -f|--inputfile ] <boxlist text file>   : Perform bin packing analysis
      [ -v|--version ]                         : Print software version
      [ -h|--help ]                            : Print the help screen

Boxlist Format
--------------
The first line of the boxlist file defines the X, Y, and Z dimensions of the pallet in which all the boxes are to be packed. Each successive line begins with a box number, then has the x, y, and z dimensions of the box, and finally how many of this box are to be packed onto the pallet.  A sample boxlist is [provided in the doc directory](https://github.com/exad/boxologic/tree/master/doc).
